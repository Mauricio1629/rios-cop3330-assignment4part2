    and hit the "Add List" button.
    
2.  If you click on a list the name of it will display above the "Edit Selected List"
    button. You can type a different name and click under it to change a list name.
     
3.  To delete a list just click on the list and hit the "Delete List" button

4.  To view a list click on the list and then the "View Selected List Content". It will be 
    empty if no items/tasks have been added.

5.  To add an item first make sure a list is clicked on and then type in the description 
    and due date display and hit the "Add Item" button. I will now show in the tableview under.

9.  To search items just click the checkboxes you want and press "Search Items". 
    The table view will now show the desired items and have the other whited out.
    If both have been clicked the list stays the same. If you click on the whited out
    boxes you can still access the item at that index through the edit description/duedate box. It is meant to visually 
    separate the compeleted and uncompleted items.
    
10. To change the description or due date of a item/task click on the item and it will now show
    on the bottom displays. You can change them there and after click the "Edit Item" button

    The file is meant to be saved as a Json file.
